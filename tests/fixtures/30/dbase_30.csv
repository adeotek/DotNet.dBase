From August 1964 to August 1866 the U.S. government instituted a law requiring that a tax stamp be attached to the backs of certain types of photograph and that it be cancelled by the selling establishment at the time of sale.  The 2 cent revenue stamp was required for images costing less than 25 cents each.  The blue 2 cent ""playing cards"" stamp was used during the summer of 1866.  Images with this stamp can be specifically dated to the summer of that year.

The stamp is hand-cancelled with the initials, H E C. and dated Jan 7.

Naval Historical Center
--Southwest Pacific Force operations against Luzon were directly supported by Seventh Fleet escort carriers in Task Group 77.4 (Rear Admiral C. T. Durgin) and indirectly by the fast carriers in Task Force 38 (Vice Admiral J. S. McCain) of Third Fleet and Central Pacific Forces. Task Group 77.4, with 17 escort carriers, covered the approach of the Luzon Attack Force against serious enemy air opposition from Kamikaze pilots which sank Ommaney Bay (4 Jan), and damaged several ships including escort carriers Manila Bay and Savo Island (5 Jan). It conducted preliminary strikes in the assault area (7-9 Jan), covered the landings in Lingayen Gulf (9 Jan), and supported the inland advance of troops ashore (9-17 Jan). Among the ships damaged by Kamikaze pilots opposing the landings were the escort carriers Kadashan Bay and Kitkun Bay (8 Jan), and Salamaua (13 Jan). Task Force 38, with seven heavy and four light carriers in three groups and one heavy and one light carrier in a night group, and accompanied by a Replenishment Group with one hunter-killer and seven escort carriers, concentrated on the destruction of enemy air power and air installations in surrounding areas. In spite of almost continuous bad weather which hampered flight operations during the entire month, this force launched offensive strikes on Formosa and the Ryukyus (3-4 Jan), a 2-day attack on Luzon (6-7 Jan) and on fields in the Formosa-Pescadores-Ryukyus area (9 Jan), destroying over 100 enemy aircraft and sinking 40,000 tons of merchant and small combatant ships in 1 week of preliminary action. During the night (9-10 Jan) Task Force 38 made a high-speed run through Luzon Strait followed by the Replenishment Group which passed through Balintang Channel, for Operations in the South China Sea (9-20 Jan). Strikes (12 Jan), over 420 miles of the Indo-China coast, reached south to Saigon and caught ships in the harbor and in coastal convoys with devastating results, sinking 12 tankers, 20 passenger and cargo vessels and numerous small combatant ships, totalling 149,000 tons. Moving northward to evade a typhoon, the force hit targets at Hong Kong, the China Coast, and Formosa (15 Jan) and next day concentrated on the Hong Kong area damaging enemy shore installations and sinking another 62,000 tons of shipping. As inclement weather persisted, the force left the South China Sea with an after dark run through Balintang Channel (20 Jan) and hit Formosa, the Pescadores, and Okinawa against enemy air opposition which damaged the Ticonderoga and Langley (20 Jan) and repeated the attack in the Ryukyus next day to finish off 3 weeks of action with an aerial score of over 600 enemy aircraft destroyed and 325,000 tons of enemy shipping sunk.
